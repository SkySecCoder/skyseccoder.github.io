			<h2>GitHub survives the biggest DDoS attack ever</h2> 
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/pic24.jpg" alt="" /></span>
		<p>2018-03-03 00:00:00 -0500</p>
		<p><p>On Feb 28th, GitHub was a victim to one the largest DDoS amplification attack ever recorded. This attack was so great that it was able to take a company like GitHub offline for approximately 10 minutes during which it was completely offline between 17:21 and 17:26 UTC, and had intermittent connectivity between 17:26 and 17:30 UTC [1].
<br /><br />The company servers were barraged with 1.35 terabits per second of traffic, but thankfully GitHub contacted Akamain Prolexic in time which took over as an intermediary, and routed all ingress and egress traffic through it’s scrubbing centres to block malicious traffic. [2] Below we can see the network traffic when the attack was taking place. The sudden spike in network traffic is extremely remarkable and scary at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://skyseccoder.github.io/assets/images/postAssets/sc1.png" style="width:500px;height:250px;" align="middle" /></p>
<p>So how did a company like GitHub get attacked by such an amplification attack. Let us first define a few things before we proceed any further.
<br /><br /><b>What is a DDoS attack?</b><br /><br />
A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attack that can bring a website/server/service offline by flooding the victim with traffic from multiple sources. This can be done by using several infected system, who generate traffic to the victim website/server/service, or simply be legitimate traffic that the victim is not prepared to handle. [4]
<br /><br /><b>What is Memcached?</b><br /><br />
Memcached is basically a free, open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system that can be used to speed up dynamic web applications. Dynamic database-driven websites usually generate small chunks of string data due to database calls, API calls or page rendering. Memcache caches these data and objects to RAM in order to reduce the number of times an external data source must be read.[3]
<br /><br />In order to carry out the attack, the attacker first implanted a large payload on an exposed memcached server. Then the attacker spoofed his/her IP address, with the victim’s IP address, and generated several “get” request message. Below we can see exactly how the attack was conducted. The servers are sending the request response to the victim because the attacker has spoofed his/her IP so that it appears that the victim had requested a response.[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://skyseccoder.github.io/images/postAssets/sc2.png" style="width:500px;height:250px;" align="middle" /></p>
<p>The protocol being used was UDP which coupled with Memcached can provide the best protocols to use for an amplification attack. There are no checks (cause of UDP), the data will be delivered to the victim extremely quickly and a tiny request can generate a huge response as can be seen below.[5]</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo tcpdump -ni eth0 port 11211 -t
<br />IP 172.16.170.135.39396 &gt; 192.168.2.1.11211: UDP, length 15
<br />IP 192.168.2.1.11211 &gt; 172.16.170.135.39396: UDP, length 1400
<br />IP 192.168.2.1.11211 &gt; 172.16.170.135.39396: UDP, length 1400
<br />...(repeated hundreds times)...
</code></pre>
<p><b>How to Fix this?</b><br /><br />
If your servers are using Memcached then you should make sure that you have disabled UDP support. By default memcached listens on INADDR_ANY and the UDP support is ENABLED. You can check if your server is vulnerable if you run the command below and you receive non-empty responses, as seen below.</p>
<pre><code>
$ echo -en "\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00stats\r\n" | nc -q1 -u 127.0.0.1 11211
STAT pid 21357
STAT uptime 41557034
STAT time 1519734962
...
</code></pre>

			<h2>SAML Implementation Vulnerability</h2> 
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/pic23.jpg" alt="" /></span>
		<p>2018-02-27 00:00:00 -0500</p>
		<p><p>A new vulnerability class has been discovered that affects several SAML-based single sign-on(SSO) systems. This particular vulnerability can allow an attacker with authenticated access, to an existing SAML system, to trick SAML systems into authenticating as a different user. By using this vulnerability the attacker does not need to know the victim’s password and can still gain access to all the resources that are assigned to the victim via the SSO.[1]</p>

<p>So what is SAML SSO?</p>

<p>SAML(Security assertion markup language) SSO basically helps users to login to various applications by first authenticating themselves to one identity provider. This identity provider then authenticates the user to several applications that are required by the user. [2] In conclusion the user has to remember one password in order to authenticate to the identity provider, instead of remembering several passwords for each and every application. (P.S. you should never have same passwords for all your applications :P) After the identity provider has authenticated the user a SAML response signature is generated which is sent to the service provider. If the signature is valid then an ID field within the response will help identify and authenticate the specified user.</p>

<p>This vulnerability basically allows a malicious person to manipulate the SAML response, more specifically the response’s “NameID”, that is provided by the Identity Provider and then gain access to services that the victim user had. [1] This vulnerability uses an unexpected behaviour of XML libraries like Python’s lxml or Ruby’s REXML, which do not take comments into considerations while parsing the “NameID”(or any identifier tag specific to an identity provider) of SAML responses. Due to this unexpected extraction an attacker can pose as another user if his/her original SAML response is similar to another user’s SAML response. More detail regarding this XML extraction can be found here [1]</p>

<p>This process is somewhat similar to getting someone else’s passport, replacing your picture with the original owner’s picture and then travelling to the original user’s country as a citizen :P</p>

<p>This manipulation basically relies on how the identity provider and the service provider implement the SAML responses and various XML APIs for python, ruby, etc.. If the implementation of the NameID(or any identifier tag specific to an identity provider) in the responses are favourable for the vulnerability then the malicious actor can do some modifications to his/her SAML response NameID due to which the signature would not be affected, and the actor will gain the victim’s access to resources.[1]</p>

<p>One use case could be a malicious contractor who was given an SSO, which limited his/her resources. Now the contractor can change his SAML response NameID so that he/she could get the resources of another user in the company who has more resources. The contractor would not even require the password for the victim employee’s SSO.</p>

<p>Multiple SAML systems were identified with this vulnerability and it is recommended that you update them if an appropriate upgrade has been released:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OneLogin - python-saml - CVE-2017-11427</li>
  <li>OneLogin - ruby-saml - CVE-2017-11428</li>
  <li>Clever - saml2-js - CVE-2017-11429</li>
  <li>OmniAuth- saml - CVE-2017-11430</li>
  <li>Shibboleth - CVE-2018-0489</li>
  <li>Duo Network Gateway - CVE-2018-7340</li>
</ul>

			<h2>Cisco WebVPN Vulnerability with a CVSS score of 10.0</h2> 
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/pic22.jpg" alt="" /></span>
		<p>2018-01-30 00:00:00 -0500</p>
		<p><p>On Jan 29th 2018, Cisco released a new vulnerability regarding their Adaptive Security Appliance(ASA). This vulnerability can be exploited provided the WebVPN feature is enabled on the ASA device. 
In my opinion no security issue, doesn’t matter how big or small, must be ignored but if the flaw has a <b>CVSS score of 10.0</b> then it certainly catches the attention of hackers and administrators all around the globe.
<br /><br />The vulnerability itself allows an unauthenticated attacker to remotely execute code and reload the affected system. This reload prevents the regular user to access resources hence this acts as a Denial of Service (DOS) attack. [1]
<br /><br />Let us first look at WebVPN and then see what actually causes this issue.
<br /><br />So WebVPN, like a normal VPN, allows a user to access resources on another network securely. It does this by using a normal browser instead of using an extra software or hardware client[2]. This is extremely useful as a user can use any computer on the internet, and not be restricted by software or hardware. WebVPN uses SSL and TLS1 for encryption and uses an ASA to recognise connections that need to be proxied and authenticated appropriately by an authentication subsystem.[2]
<br /><br />In order to exploit the WebVPN issue an attacker will have to send multiple crafted XML packets to a WebVPN configured interface of the ASA. This will basically cause an attempt to double free a region of memory on the ASA device. To make matters worse, since WebVPN does not utilise any software, hardware or certificates, there is no way that the client system can be authenticated. This potentially allows an attacker to conduct the attack from anywhere that has access to the internet. [2]
<br /><br />If this is successfully attempted then the attacker can have unrestricted access to the protected network where he/she is free to execute any code on the network. This also paves the way to utilise several known attack vectors to conduct attacks. Also, yes there is an also, Cisco has released some software updates that address this, but there are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
<br /><br />If you utilise the following ASA products then you should apply the appropriate patches as and when CISCO releases them: [1]</p>
<ul>
  <li>3000 Series Industrial Security Appliance (ISA)</li>
  <li>ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances</li>
  <li>ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls</li>
  <li>ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers</li>
  <li>ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall</li>
  <li>Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)</li>
  <li>Firepower 2100 Series Security Appliance</li>
  <li>Firepower 4110 Security Appliance</li>
  <li>Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module</li>
  <li>Firepower Threat Defense Software (FTD)
<br /><br />It should be noted that this issue affects vulnerable releases of Cisco ASA software where WebVPN is enabled. Also an SSL and DTLS listen socket must be present on the TCP port 443(port for HTTPS). If your ASA is running a version prior to 9., 9.3 or 9.5 then Cisco recommends a version update. Full details on how to check if you are affected can be found here by following the link in reference [1].</li>

			<h2>What are Meltdown and Spectre?</h2> 
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/pic21.jpg" alt="" /></span>
		<p>2018-01-03 00:00:00 -0500</p>
		<p><p>Meltdown and Spectre are basically hardware bugs that allow programs to steal data which is currently processed on the system.</p>

<p>In order to better understand these flaws we should first understand speculative execution. Speculative execution is basically an optimization technique where a system tries to predict which calculations to perform in order to complete a task. It tries to accomplish this by performing tasks that may or may not be required. Basically it does a work before it is known by the system if it is required for the task. If the work was not required then the system simply reverts the changes, that occurred in order to the work, and simply ignores the results. This is done to attain more concurrency for a task, provided the system has resources to spare. This basically wastes CPU cycles by performing unnecessary work but is able to perform chain of commands much faster when compared to the alternative, which is to perform them one after the other. [1]</p>

<p>Although speculative execution is a good thing it does pose an issue for several modern processors including the Intel X86 microprocessors. These processors are hardcoded, for speculative execution, in such a way that they do not check for permissions (of a user, process or application) and can skip commands altogether. Due to this, programs can potentially steal protected information from kernal memory. [1] This kernal memory is generally supposed to be isolated from user programs but in this case (for speculative execution) the program can access information such as passwords or stored files. This is the main principle that both these vulnerabilities utilize.</p>

<p><b>Meltdown Vulnerability</b></p>

<p>Meltdown Vulnerability has a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ID of CVE-2017-5754 [2]. It basically breaks the isolation between user applications and the operating system, which allows an attacker to access important memory like passwords. Luckily there are software patches against Meltdown which should be applied immediately. [3]</p>

<p><b>Spectre Vulnerability</b></p>

<p>The Spectre Vulnerability is a composite of 2 issues that have Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures IDs of CVE-2017-5715 and CVE-2017-5753 [4].  Unlike Meltdown, Spectre breaks the isolation between different applications which in essence allows an attacker to trick another program, into leaking information. Oddly enough if the program is error free and follows recommended safety checks, then it is more prone to this vulnerability. My assumption is that the checks simply provide a larger surface area or more opportunities for the malicious program to trick the error-free victim program. [3] This is an extremely hard issue to exploit and fix but it is possible to prevent specific known Spectre exploits through software patches [3].</p>

<p>As can be seen, these issues mainly concern entities that rely on cloud infrastructures or offer cloud services like Amazon or Google and it may or may not affect regular users.</p>

<p>Following are a few FAQ related to these vulnerabilities. Further details can be found [3] here: [3]</p>

<p><b>Am I affected by the bug? </b><br />
Most certainly, yes.</p>

<p><b>Can I detect if someone has exploited Meltdown or Spectre against me? </b><br />
Probably not. The exploitation does not leave any traces in traditional log files.</p>

<p><b>Can my antivirus detect or block this attack? </b><br />
While possible in theory, this is unlikely in practice. Unlike usual malware, Meltdown and Spectre are hard to distinguish from regular benign applications. However, your antivirus may detect malware which uses the attacks by comparing binaries after they become known.</p>

<p><b>Is there a workaround/fix? </b><br />
There are patches against Meltdown for Linux ( KPTI (formerly KAISER)), Windows, and OS X. There is also work to harden software against future exploitation of Spectre, respectively to patch software after exploitation through Spectre .</p>

<p><b>Which systems are affected by Meltdown? </b><br />
Desktop, Laptop, and Cloud computers may be affected by Meltdown. More technically, every Intel processor which implements out-of-order execution is potentially affected, which is effectively every processor since 1995 (except Intel Itanium and Intel Atom before 2013). At the moment, it is unclear whether ARM and AMD processors are also affected by Meltdown.</p>

<p><b>Which systems are affected by Spectre? </b><br />
Almost every system is affected by Spectre: Desktops, Laptops, Cloud Servers, as well as Smartphones. More specifically, all modern processors capable of keeping many instructions in flight are potentially vulnerable. In particular, Intel, AMD, and ARM processors.</p>

<p><b>Which cloud providers are affected by Meltdown? </b><br />
Cloud providers which use Intel CPUs and Xen PV as virtualization without having patches applied. Furthermore, cloud providers without real hardware virtualization, relying on containers that share one kernel, such as Docker, LXC, or OpenVZ are affected.</p>

			<h2>Architectures for deploying a firewall in a company</h2> 
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/pic19.jpg" alt="" /></span>
		<p>2018-01-01 00:00:00 -0500</p>
		<p><p>Let us first define Firewalls before we discuss an architecture for deploying a firewall in a company. A firewall [1] is a hardware or software system that prevents unauthorised access to or from a network. Firewalls are an important part of businesses in today’s day and age, where corporate espionage and cyber attacks are as common as air.</p>

<p><br />There is no universal architecture a company can use. While selecting a firewall the company has to keep the following factors in mind: [2]</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the firewall giving the desired security level</li>
  <li>Is the firewall scalable depending on the company’s needs</li>
  <li>Is the firewall cost effective</li>
  <li>Does the firewall provide support for the size of the organisation</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several different types of architectures that a company can choose from but the three main architectures that are used commercially are: [3]</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bastion host</li>
  <li>Screened subnet</li>
  <li>Dual firewall with DMZ
In a bastion host [3] the firewall is placed between the internet and the protected network. The bastion is the cheapest amongst the mentioned topology and is perfect for relatively simple networks, although once the firewall is bypassed the user will have unrestricted access to the protected network. This topology is suited for small growing business but would not be a good option for a big company.</li>
</ul>

<p>The screened subnet topology [3] offers additional advantages over the bastion host approach as it uses a single firewall with three networks connected to it (the internet, intranet and a DMZ). The host public services are placed in the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), which is separated from both the internet and the trusted network by the firewall, therefore if a malicious user does manage to bypass the firewall, they will not have access to the intranet. This architecture allows a company to offer services to the internet users while still maintaining security, it is a good architecture for an e-commerce company as it allows them to securely yet efficiently divide their networks.</p>

<p>The most secure and the most expensive option is to implement a screened subnet [3] using 2 firewalls. In this case the DMZ is placed between 2 firewalls which provides an added layer of security. This still allows the company to offer services to the internet users and at the same time protects the company if a malicious user discovers a software-specific exploitable vulnerability. Just incase the malicious user gets past the first firewall due to an exploit the inspection at the second firewall will block the user from entering the secured network.</p>

<p>In computer networks, a DMZ [4] (demilitarised zone) is a physical or logical sub-network that separates an internal local area network from other untrusted networks. Servers for clients, resources and services are located in the DMZ so that users on the internet can use them but the rest of the network (LAN) remains unreachable from the internet.</p>

<p>Hence in conclusion there is no universal topology that all company use and a company should choose a topology that is best suited for their need.</p>

			<h2>Difference between Information Security and Computer Security</h2>

		<p>2017-09-15 00:00:00 -0400</p>
		<p><p>In order to diffrentiate between computer and information security let us first define the two forms of security.</p>

<h3>Computer security</h3>
<p>It is basically measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of information system assets including hardware, software, firmware, and information being processed, stored, and communicated.[1]</p>

<h3>Information Security</h3>
<p>It is the protection of information and information systems from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.[2] It not deals with all the assests that computer security deals with but also deals with the human aspect as well. People are an integral part of information security as they are the weakest link in the information security infrastructure. The strongest of information security is useless if an authorised user compromises the system</p>

<p>Confidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for security within an organisation.[3] Although both forms of security follow the same CIA model both computer and information security have a few differences. At first we may see that computer security is only about the hardware aspect, but it also takes into account the software, firmware, and information being stored and communicated. Information security handles all the things that computer security handles but the key difference lies in the fact that information security keeps into account the people who would be accessing the system. Hence we can say that computer security is a subset of information security.</p>

<p>A threat is any indication, circumstance, or event with the potential to cause harm to an ICT(Information and Communications technology) infrastructure and the assets that depend on this infrastructure.[1]</p>
<h3>Attack</h3>
<p>An attack is a deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. An attacker uses malicious code to alter computer, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrime, such as information and identity theft.[2]</p>

<p>We can mainly differentiate a threat and an attack in three ways: <br />
-A threat can be intentional or unintentional  whereas an attack is always intentional. An example of a threat could be an employee who may be incompetent and accidentally leaks out sensitive information, but on the other hand an employee who knows what he is doing and who purposefully leaks out the sensitive information would be considered an attacker performing an attack which in this case is the leaking of sensitive information.
<br />-Threat is basically a circumstance that has potential to cause harm whereas an attack is intended to cause harm. We can also say that a threat is a passive entity that is defined by it’s potential vector whereas an attack is always intentional.
<br />-A threat to the information system doesn’t necessarily mean that the information was altered or damaged but attack on the information system means there might be a chance to alter, damage, or obtain information when attack was successful. To explain this better we can revisit the example of the incompetent and attacker employee. Although the incompetent employee is a threat, until he leaks the sensitive information there was no harm done to the information, whereas the other employee was not an attacker or had done an attack, until he purposefully leaked the information. When he leaked the information he was considered an attacker who had done an attack, and damaged the information.[3]</p>

<p>The two entities can be defined and differentiated  by intent to cause harm. A threat doesn’t intend to cause harm, it accidentally  may or may not cause harm but an attack is always intended to cause harm.</p>

			<h2>Pros and cons of law enforcement involvement in a cyber security incident</h2> 
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/pic15.png" alt="" /></span>
		<p>2017-09-12 00:00:00 -0400</p>
		<p><p>Companies face incidents almost on a regular basis. Some incidents may be small and may not affect the company at all or the incident could be so devastating that costs the company resources, time and/or reputation. If the company feels that it could handle the incident internally with reasonable resources then they generally do not escalate the incident to the law enforcement but if the company feels that the incident is so out of hand that it can cause major damage to the company, financially or otherwise, then the company looks to the law enforcement agencies for help. Company’s decision to escalate or not escalate the incident lies mainly in the pros and cons that are involved with the participation of law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>We will start with the pros that come by involving law enforcement agencies for handling the incident. The government has set various protocols and laws that help with the investigation of the incident, for example in the United States the Presidential Policy Directive-41[1] divides the major areas in incident handling, and assigns those areas to suitable government agencies that can efficiently handle them. These agencies are:</p>

<p>-The Department of Justice</p>

<p>-The Department of Homeland Security</p>

<p>-The office of the Director of National Intelligence</p>

<p>The United States government also has alliances like the National Cyber Forensics &amp; Training Alliance[2] and alliances with various countries that together share information, intelligence and various ways to tackle various forms of cyber attacks. The government also exercises various legal powers like subpoenas and making warrants to investigate other company’s databases and homes of possible suspects. The government also encourages companies to approach them in times of crisis. The executive Order 13636 [3] was also introduced that promotes safety, security, business confidentiality, privacy and civil liberties. This policy can basically be used to strengthen the company’s critical infrastructure while maintaining confidentiality and privacy. It is also possible that the company may not be as well prepared to handle the incident as the government, for example it may not have the policies, protocols or resources to deal with the incident. In summary the United States government helps companies handle incidents by using policies, using t’s resources like information and intelligence, legal powers, and at the same time maintaining confidentiality about the companies critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>Although the decision to escalate the issue to the law enforcement agencies does have it’s perks, it also has some drawbacks as well. When a company hands over a case to the law agencies the company in context loses any say in the investigation, the agencies do not allow the company to make any decisions regarding the investigation. The agencies also take over any data or resource that may help in their investigations, usually in such cases they are critical infrastructures and valuable data. Due to the agencies acquirement of such resources, the company suffers a huge time delay and indirectly profit loss, that as a whole affects the company’s value. Due to the agency’s involvement the incident may leak to the press that can damage the company’s reputation and reliability.</p>

<p>In my opinion involving the law enforcement agencies has it’s pros and cons which have to be carefully examined and calculated before making any decision to escalate the incident. The company has to make a decision that is most profitable to them.</p>

			<h2>IDS and IPS</h2> 
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/pic18.jpg" alt="" /></span>

		<p><p>IDS or intrusion detection system[1] is a passive security solution which in essence just warns us if a suspicious activity has taken place and not actually prevent them. It monitors all inbound and outbound network traffic and identify any suspicious activity or patterns that may indicate a network or system attack from someone attempting to break into or compromise a system. An IDS specifically looks for suspicious activity and events that might be the result of a virus, worm or hacker. After detecting the anomaly the IDS responds in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it can display an alert</li>
  <li>log the event</li>
  <li>
    <p>page the administrator
IPS or intrusion prevention system[1] is the next level of security technology with the capability to provide security at all system levels from the OS kernel to data packets. It is a more active security solution as it not only detects the attacks and reports them, like the IDS, but also attempts to stop them. It not only prevents known intrusion signatures but also the unknown attacks due to its database of generic attack behaviours. Currently there are two types of IPSs that are similar in nature to IDS:</p>
  </li>
  <li>host based intrusion prevention systems</li>
  <li>
    <p>network based intrusion prevention systems
To improve on their current IDSs, vendors like CISCO, Alert Logic, Check point Software technologies and DeepNines [2] have modified their previous IDS product so that they provide additional functions for the user. They have tried to covert their IDSs to IPSs. An example is the CISCO Next- Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) [3] . CISCO has added various features to their previous IDS to turn them into NGIPS, a few of these modifications include: [4]</p>
  </li>
  <li>Network awareness: provides a knowledge of the devices that exists on the network (OS, device types, etc.)</li>
  <li>Application Awareness: provides the ability to pick out and highlight application that are being run on the network and the users running that are running them</li>
  <li>Identity awareness: provides the ability to establish and monitor the baseline behaviour of the network devices</li>
  <li>Real time automated response: ability to respond to events as they occur and react with the appropriate response based on policy</li>
  <li>Automatic IPS tuning ability for a platform to dynamically tune itself based on the information gathered.
In summary an IDS simply detects a suspicious activity on a network and reports them whereas an IPS also takes measures to prevent such suspicious behaviour. We have also discussed one of many vendors (CISCO) who have improved on their current IDSs to convert them into IPSs. Many mentioned vendors have added similar functions as the NGIPS in their current IDS products to turn them into IPSs.</li>

			<h2>Replacement of damaged asset vs repairing damaged asset</h2> 
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/pic17.jpg" alt="" /></span>
		<p>2017-09-10 00:00:00 -0400</p>
		<p><p>Companies deal with information loss or damage, almost on a regular basis. The main question rises what to do next after the damage has been done. Companies try to find ways to minimise their damages and costs by appropriately taking measures to do so, they can choose to completely replace their damaged/lost information assets, leave the damaged asset as is or they can choose to repair the damage done to the asset. In order to make the most suitable decision the company has to estimate the value of the asset and cost for handling the damage. Various assessments methods for evaluating the worth of the asset are:</p>

<p>-Replacement cost</p>

<p>-Income lost while repairing</p>

<p>-Income lost while Replacing the asset</p>

<p>The replacement cost is considered when the asset is not worth too much to the company and it would cost less to replace the asset rather than repair the asset. We can explain this point better with an example. Big companies generally have big servers to manage their traffic, suppose the servers get damaged, in order to minimise the time that the servers are down the company can simply replace the servers. Although replacing servers costs a lot and maybe a smaller company would not choose this route, as it lacks the resources to do so. When the company takes this decision it usually takes into account two aspects when replacing the asset; first the cost of replacing the asset and the income lost wile replacing the asset. The company tried to minimise its server’s down time as the company would lose profitability if the servers are not continuously running. Replacement cost is simply the cost of replacing the asset but while the asset is non-functioning the company can lose its value as the asset has now become a liability and has stopped the operations of the company. Another reason (other than hinderance of operations of the company) could also be that the asset has been severely compromised and is a huge liability for the company. These factors may not affect the smaller companies as much as it would the bigger companies hence the smaller companies can choose alternative methods to deal with the situation.</p>

<p>Repairing the asset is generally considered when the asset’s information is worth a considerable amount to the company. Big companies usually have a plethora of important data and in most cases the data is invaluable to the company. The company may prioritise its data recovery and spend time and money recovering/repairing the information. This repairing process may cause the company to slow down its operations which can lower the profitability of the company hence companies choose this option if the information is worth more than the cost of damages and repairs ,or the company does not have money to replace the asset as is the case of smaller companies.</p>

<p>In summary we can see that a company may prioritise different things when coming up with a decision to replace or repair the asset. The companies look at: [1]</p>

<p>-Cost to replace the asset</p>

<p>-Cost to repair the asset</p>

<p>-liability issues if the asset is severely compromised</p>

<p>-value of the asset</p>

<p>-operational and productivity costs incurred if the asset is unavailable.</p>

<p>The companies take into account the points mentioned above when deciding the value of the asset and taking appropriate decisions. Also every company is different in their own regards and will choose a course of action that is most profitable to the company and most effective in dealing with the problem.</p>
