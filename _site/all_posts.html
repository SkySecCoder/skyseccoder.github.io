			<h2>Difference between Information Security and Computer Security</h2>

		<p>2017-09-15 00:00:00 -0400</p>
		<p><p>In order to diffrentiate between computer and information security let us first define the two forms of security.</p>

<h3>Computer security</h3>
<p>It is basically measures and controls that ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of information system assets including hardware, software, firmware, and information being processed, stored, and communicated.[1]</p>

<h3>Information Security</h3>
<p>It is the protection of information and information systems from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.[2] It not deals with all the assests that computer security deals with but also deals with the human aspect as well. People are an integral part of information security as they are the weakest link in the information security infrastructure. The strongest of information security is useless if an authorised user compromises the system</p>

<p>Confidentiality, integrity and availability, also known as the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for security within an organisation.[3] Although both forms of security follow the same CIA model both computer and information security have a few differences. At first we may see that computer security is only about the hardware aspect, but it also takes into account the software, firmware, and information being stored and communicated. Information security handles all the things that computer security handles but the key difference lies in the fact that information security keeps into account the people who would be accessing the system. Hence we can say that computer security is a subset of information security.</p>

			<h2>Difference between threat and attack</h2> 
		</header>

		<p>2017-09-14 00:00:00 -0400</p>
		<p><p>In order to differentiate between an attack and threat, let us first define the two terms.</p>

<h3>Threat</h3>
<p>A threat is any indication, circumstance, or event with the potential to cause harm to an ICT(Information and Communications technology) infrastructure and the assets that depend on this infrastructure.[1]</p>
<h3>Attack</h3>
<p>An attack is a deliberate exploitation of computer systems, technology-dependent enterprises and networks. An attacker uses malicious code to alter computer, logic or data, resulting in disruptive consequences that can compromise data and lead to cybercrime, such as information and identity theft.[2]</p>

<p>We can mainly differentiate a threat and an attack in three ways: <br />
-A threat can be intentional or unintentional  whereas an attack is always intentional. An example of a threat could be an employee who may be incompetent and accidentally leaks out sensitive information, but on the other hand an employee who knows what he is doing and who purposefully leaks out the sensitive information would be considered an attacker performing an attack which in this case is the leaking of sensitive information.
<br />-Threat is basically a circumstance that has potential to cause harm whereas an attack is intended to cause harm. We can also say that a threat is a passive entity that is defined by it’s potential vector whereas an attack is always intentional.
<br />-A threat to the information system doesn’t necessarily mean that the information was altered or damaged but attack on the information system means there might be a chance to alter, damage, or obtain information when attack was successful. To explain this better we can revisit the example of the incompetent and attacker employee. Although the incompetent employee is a threat, until he leaks the sensitive information there was no harm done to the information, whereas the other employee was not an attacker or had done an attack, until he purposefully leaked the information. When he leaked the information he was considered an attacker who had done an attack, and damaged the information.[3]</p>

<p>The two entities can be defined and differentiated  by intent to cause harm. A threat doesn’t intend to cause harm, it accidentally  may or may not cause harm but an attack is always intended to cause harm.</p>

			<h2>Pros and cons of law enforcement involvement in a cyber security incident</h2> 
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
		<p>2017-09-12 00:00:00 -0400</p>
		<p><p>Companies face incidents almost on a regular basis. Some incidents may be small and may not affect the company at all or the incident could be so devastating that costs the company resources, time and/or reputation. If the company feels that it could handle the incident internally with reasonable resources then they generally do not escalate the incident to the law enforcement but if the company feels that the incident is so out of hand that it can cause major damage to the company, financially or otherwise, then the company looks to the law enforcement agencies for help. Company’s decision to escalate or not escalate the incident lies mainly in the pros and cons that are involved with the participation of law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>We will start with the pros that come by involving law enforcement agencies for handling the incident. The government has set various protocols and laws that help with the investigation of the incident, for example in the United States the Presidential Policy Directive-41[1] divides the major areas in incident handling, and assigns those areas to suitable government agencies that can efficiently handle them. These agencies are:</p>

<p>-The Department of Justice</p>

<p>-The Department of Homeland Security</p>

<p>-The office of the Director of National Intelligence</p>

<p>The United States government also has alliances like the National Cyber Forensics &amp; Training Alliance[2] and alliances with various countries that together share information, intelligence and various ways to tackle various forms of cyber attacks. The government also exercises various legal powers like subpoenas and making warrants to investigate other company’s databases and homes of possible suspects. The government also encourages companies to approach them in times of crisis. The executive Order 13636 [3] was also introduced that promotes safety, security, business confidentiality, privacy and civil liberties. This policy can basically be used to strengthen the company’s critical infrastructure while maintaining confidentiality and privacy. It is also possible that the company may not be as well prepared to handle the incident as the government, for example it may not have the policies, protocols or resources to deal with the incident. In summary the United States government helps companies handle incidents by using policies, using t’s resources like information and intelligence, legal powers, and at the same time maintaining confidentiality about the companies critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>Although the decision to escalate the issue to the law enforcement agencies does have it’s perks, it also has some drawbacks as well. When a company hands over a case to the law agencies the company in context loses any say in the investigation, the agencies do not allow the company to make any decisions regarding the investigation. The agencies also take over any data or resource that may help in their investigations, usually in such cases they are critical infrastructures and valuable data. Due to the agencies acquirement of such resources, the company suffers a huge time delay and indirectly profit loss, that as a whole affects the company’s value. Due to the agency’s involvement the incident may leak to the press that can damage the company’s reputation and reliability.</p>

<p>In my opinion involving the law enforcement agencies has it’s pros and cons which have to be carefully examined and calculated before making any decision to escalate the incident. The company has to make a decision that is most profitable to them.</p>

			<h2>Architectures for deploying firewalls that are most commonly used in businesses</h2> 
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
		<p>2017-09-11 00:00:00 -0400</p>
		<p><p>Let us first define Firewalls before we discuss an architecture for deploying a firewall in a company. A firewall [1] is a hardware or software system that prevents unauthorised access to or from a network. Firewalls are an important part of businesses in today’s day and age, where corporate espionage and cyber attacks are as common as air.</p>

<p>There is no universal architecture a company can use. While selecting a firewall the company has to keep the following factors in mind: [2]</p>

<p>Is the firewall giving the desired security level
Is the firewall scalable depending on the company’s needs
Is the firewall cost effective
Does the firewall provide support for the size of the organisation
There are several different types of architectures that a company can choose from but the three main architectures that are used commercially are: [3]</p>

<p>Bastion host
Screened subnet
Dual firewall with DMZ
In a bastion host [3] the firewall is placed between the internet and the protected network. The bastion is the cheapest amongst the mentioned topology and is perfect for relatively simple networks, although once the firewall is bypassed the user will have unrestricted access to the protected network. This topology is suited for small growing business but would not be a good option for a big company.</p>

<p>The screened subnet topology [3] offers additional advantages over the bastion host approach as it uses a single firewall with three networks connected to it (the internet, intranet and a DMZ). The host public services are placed in the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), which is separated from both the internet and the trusted network by the firewall, therefore if a malicious user does manage to bypass the firewall, they will not have access to the intranet. This architecture allows a company to offer services to the internet users while still maintaining security, it is a good architecture for an e-commerce company as it allows them to securely yet efficiently divide their networks.</p>

<p>The most secure and the most expensive option is to implement a screened subnet [3] using 2 firewalls. In this case the DMZ is placed between 2 firewalls which provides an added layer of security. This still allows the company to offer services to the internet users and at the same time protects the company if a malicious user discovers a software-specific exploitable vulnerability. Just incase the malicious user gets past the first firewall due to an exploit the inspection at the second firewall will block the user from entering the secured network.</p>

<p>In computer networks, a DMZ(demilitarised zone) [4] is a physical or logical sub-network that separates an internal local area network from other untrusted networks. Servers for clients, resources and services are located in the DMZ so that users on the internet can use them but the rest of the network (LAN) remains unreachable from the internet.</p>

<p>Hence in conclusion there is no universal topology that all company use and a company should choose a topology that is best suited for their need.</p>

			<h2>Replacement of damaged asset vs repairing damaged asset</h2> 
		</header>
		<span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></span>
		<p>2017-09-09 00:00:00 -0400</p>
		<p><p>Companies deal with information loss or damage, almost on a regular basis. The main question rises what to do next after the damage has been done. Companies try to find ways to minimise their damages and costs by appropriately taking measures to do so, they can choose to completely replace their damaged/lost information assets, leave the damaged asset as is or they can choose to repair the damage done to the asset. In order to make the most suitable decision the company has to estimate the value of the asset and cost for handling the damage. Various assessments methods for evaluating the worth of the asset are:</p>

<p>-Replacement cost</p>

<p>-Income lost while repairing</p>

<p>-Income lost while Replacing the asset</p>

<p>The replacement cost is considered when the asset is not worth too much to the company and it would cost less to replace the asset rather than repair the asset. We can explain this point better with an example. Big companies generally have big servers to manage their traffic, suppose the servers get damaged, in order to minimise the time that the servers are down the company can simply replace the servers. Although replacing servers costs a lot and maybe a smaller company would not choose this route, as it lacks the resources to do so. When the company takes this decision it usually takes into account two aspects when replacing the asset; first the cost of replacing the asset and the income lost wile replacing the asset. The company tried to minimise its server’s down time as the company would lose profitability if the servers are not continuously running. Replacement cost is simply the cost of replacing the asset but while the asset is non-functioning the company can lose its value as the asset has now become a liability and has stopped the operations of the company. Another reason (other than hinderance of operations of the company) could also be that the asset has been severely compromised and is a huge liability for the company. These factors may not affect the smaller companies as much as it would the bigger companies hence the smaller companies can choose alternative methods to deal with the situation.</p>

<p>Repairing the asset is generally considered when the asset’s information is worth a considerable amount to the company. Big companies usually have a plethora of important data and in most cases the data is invaluable to the company. The company may prioritise its data recovery and spend time and money recovering/repairing the information. This repairing process may cause the company to slow down its operations which can lower the profitability of the company hence companies choose this option if the information is worth more than the cost of damages and repairs ,or the company does not have money to replace the asset as is the case of smaller companies.</p>

<p>In summary we can see that a company may prioritise different things when coming up with a decision to replace or repair the asset. The companies look at: [1]</p>

<p>-Cost to replace the asset</p>

<p>-Cost to repair the asset</p>

<p>-liability issues if the asset is severely compromised</p>

<p>-value of the asset</p>

<p>-operational and productivity costs incurred if the asset is unavailable.</p>

<p>The companies take into account the points mentioned above when deciding the value of the asset and taking appropriate decisions. Also every company is different in their own regards and will choose a course of action that is most profitable to the company and most effective in dealing with the problem.</p>
